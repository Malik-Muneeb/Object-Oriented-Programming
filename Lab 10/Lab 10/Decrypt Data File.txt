File encryption is the science of writing the contents of a file in a secret code. Your encryptionprogram should work like a filter, reading the contents of one file, modifying the data into a code,and then writing the coded contents out to a second file. The second file will be a version of the firstfile, but written in a secret code. Although there are complex encryption techniques, you shouldcome up with a simple one of your own. For example, you could read the first file one character at atime, and add 10 to the ASCII code of each character before it is written to the second file.
